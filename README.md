A. Unity — Project Structure Best Practices
=============


Scope:
* Folder Structure
* Folder Naming
* File Naming

Benefits:

* Consistency — The project structure has consistency in presentation regardless of team location, spoken language, or individual programmers.
* Maintenance — Consistent project structure will aid readability. Readability helps new and existing programmers revisit the code base for fixes and improvements.
* Communication — Developers more implicitly understand each other in written and verbal communication.

B. Coding Standards
=============

This repo holds the code for the Coding Standards.

Coding standards define a programming style. A coding standard does not usually concern itself with wrong or right in a more abstract sense. It is simply a set of rules and guidelines for the formatting of source code.

Scope:

* Naming Conventions
* File Naming and Organization
* Formatting and Indentation
* Comments and Documentation
* Classes, Functions and Interfaces
* Testing

Benefits:

* Code Integration
* Team Member Integration
* Maintenance
* Uniform Problem Solving
* Minimizes Communication
* Minimizes Performance Pitfalls
* Saves Money Due to Less Man Hours
